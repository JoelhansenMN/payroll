# Employee Payroll Application

## Description

- This week's homework challenge required us to take starter code and modify it so that we have a working functioning where the use can enter information (employee's first and last name and salry) and generate a table on the website.  The user is prompted  you to modify starter code to create an application that enables a payroll manager to view and manage employee payroll data. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write.
